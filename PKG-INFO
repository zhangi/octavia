        Octavia is an operator-grade open source scalable load balancer for use in
        large OpenStack deployments.
        
        Octavia provides the load balancing API for OpenStack. It supports multiple
        "provider drivers" that implement load balancing, including the "amphora"
        reference driver included with Octavia.
